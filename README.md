### Hi there 👋

I am Angel. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) 🇪🇸 and part of the Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technologies (PRHLT) Research Center. Moreover, I am a researcher at RMIT University 🇦🇺 in the Centre for Information Discovery and Data Analytics (CIDDA).
I have recently worked with Deep Learning and LLMs to detect and classify **Sexism**, **Toxic Language**, and **Hate Speech**.

Please check out my recent [work](https://github.com/AngelFelipeMP/Mitigating-Negative-Transfer-with-TA) to see which technologies I have hands-on experience with.

Feel free to contact me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angel-de-paula/).
