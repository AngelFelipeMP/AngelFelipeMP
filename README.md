### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Angel. I am a Ph.D. researcher in the Natural Language Engineering Lab. at Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technologies (PRHLT) Research Center in the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia (UPV).  I've recently worked with Deep Learning and Transformer models to detect and classify **Toxic Language** and **Hate Speech**.

Please check out my recent [work](https://github.com/AngelFelipeMP/BERT-tweets-sexims-classification), where you can see which technologies I have hands-on experience.
